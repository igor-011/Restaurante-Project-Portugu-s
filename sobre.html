            <h1 class="tiltle f-white ">After bankruptcy, celebrity chef Érick Jacquin shines again in the kitchen</h1>
            <p>Known to the general public for his work on the MasterChef program, the chef closed his last restaurant due to being buried in debts. Now, he returns to the stoves with Président, inaugurated in December in São Paulo.</p>
            <p>Despite his talent as a chef, when the first Brazilian edition of the program was launched in 2014, Jacquin was a bankrupt person, drowned in debts, facing several labor lawsuits, and away from the stoves.</p>
            <p>It was his success with MasterChef (and other fame-related products such as lectures, commercials, and other television programs) that allowed Jacquin to pay off his debts (estimated to exceed R$ 1 million) and have a restaurant of his own again. Jacquin swears he learned his lesson. The first is to never deal with the financial or human resources aspect of the business again.</p>
            <p>"That's with my partner," he says, after narrating how the bank manager made him take unnecessary loans when he was in charge of his last restaurant, La Brasserie, closed in 2013.</p>

            <p>Since the closure of La Brasserie, due to – believe it or not – lack of customers and also because of debts, Leone, then a loyal customer of the chef, had been sounding out the chef to return to the kitchen. "He always told me he wasn't ready. Until last year, when he hinted at the possibility," says Leone.</p>
            <p>Jacquin's yes made the businessman invest heavily. "It was a lot of money, twice what I expected," he says, without revealing the figures. In the kitchen, there was no skimping: state-of-the-art equipment is at the chef's and his team's disposal. The kitchen is open to the dining room, and Jacquin works – and shines – on an illuminated platform similar to the MasterChef set.</p>
            <p>The decor of the dining room bets on red, the color of many French brasseries. On one of the walls, various personal items of Jacquin are displayed, such as a menu from Le Coq Hardy, the first restaurant where he worked in Brazil, or a photo of the chef when he was young, taken for the cover of a magazine.</p>
            <p>On another wall, there is a gallery with paintings of all French presidents. "Emmanuel Macron is in the center, but he will lose this position in the next election," points out Jacquin. At the back of the room, a huge mirror brings a sense of spaciousness to the place.</p>
            <p>But it is the kitchen that will dictate the success of the venture. Jacquin's partners in previous projects always questioned the amount spent on some ingredients, and Jacquin's kitchen is filled with foie gras, scallops, caviar, and truffles. They are part of the belief that a good chef is rarely a good administrator, and few know how to calculate the cost of a dish.</p>
